Extensible markup language (XML) is set of rules used to structure data for storage and transport. In an XML file, there are tags and text. The tags act as the structure to the data. The text is the data to be stored surrounded by the tags.

## Project Description
In this project, we provide a tool for editting an XML file covering the following parts:
- Checking for syntax errors, and edit them if any.
- Formatting the file whether to make it easier to read, or to decrease its size.
Also, the program can covert the input XML file to JSON (Javascript Object Notation) which is another format that is
used to represent data. Itâ€™s useful especially when using javascript; as there are many libraries and tools that use JSON notation.
